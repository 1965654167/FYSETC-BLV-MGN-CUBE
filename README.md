# FYSETC-BLV-MGN-CUBE
This is a BLV project that comes from Ben Levi, and its name is BLV MGN Cube.We've made some optimizations on top of that, and we hope you like it.Fysetc is one of the suppliers of BLV. We really like and appreciate Ben's design .

2.BLV mgn Cube STL file update 2021.4.27
These print files are suitable for FYSETC BLV mgn Cube 3D printer. We have made some improvements based on the BLV mgn Cube print files, the main purpose is to make the printed parts better install. For example: no filament falling, no support needed, new Endstop mounting bracket, extruder mounting bracket for easy installation of the shell, printing parts that support 5I display bevel installation, large thumb nuts can be installed, etc.You can also download the STL file through the following link:

6.Advantage:
1）Replace Arduino pro mini and LM2596 with an integrated module, the plug-in is simple and firm, and the installation is convenient
2）The original power supply is only 450W, and the total power of the machine exceeds 400W, which poses a safety hazard. We use high-power 600W Meanwell power supply, which can provide powerful power to the machine, and the machine runs more stable.
3）Equipped with E3D all-metal throat and E3D PTFE straight-through throat, the all-metal throat can print high-temperature consumables, and the PTFE straight-through throat can print conventional consumables with a smoother surface.
4）Using 3D touch leveling switch, automatic leveling, simple leveling operation.
5）Upgrade the Z-axis Teflon screw, which has the advantages of low friction coefficient, smoothness, chemical resistance, non-sticky surface and easy to clean.
6）Provide a complete set of wires connected to the terminal, plug and play, easy to use.
7）The platform adopts high-power aluminum substrate heating bed and lattice glass, which can ensure high flatness, adhesion and mold taking effect, and fast heating speed. Thermal insulation cotton is attached to the bottom to reduce heat loss, energy saving and environmental protection.
8）The new aluminum-plastic panel shell with a countersunk head, and a carbon fiber texture sticker, is beautiful and generous.
9）Change the hole position for each print, the printing does not fall down, does not need support, easy to install screws, easy to print and install.
10）Purchasing DUET2 motherboard plus 5I display, powerful functions, support SD card + WIFI.
11）The Hotbed adjusting nut is replaced with a larger and more usable hand-tightened nut, which is convenient and practical to adjust.
12）The new version of the framework is adopted, and the appearance is concise.
13）It adopts linear guide, stable operation and high precision.
14）Adding sound insulation cotton can reduce noise.
15）A nozzle cleaner is installed, which can wipe the nozzle and effectively clean the residual consumables on the nozzle.
16）There are three ring lights installed, which can display part of the status of printing.
17）Installed with LED lighting, it is convenient to observe the status of the model being printed.
18）The extruder adopts BMG extruder, which can increase the extruding force of the large distance, ensure the smooth and effective extrusion of consumables, and improve the printing quality.
19）The filter cotton is installed to filter the air.
20）Supports shutdown after printing. The machine will shut down after the temperature has cooled down after printing, which is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
